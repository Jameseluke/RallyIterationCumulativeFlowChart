Basic Iteration Cumulative Flow Chart
=========================

## Overview
Very simple iteration CFD based on the Rally standard report, but with the ability to select iteration using an iteration combobox instead of using a timebox. This was needed because adding a timebox to a page removes the ability to choose scope, limiting the power of dashboards for multiple projects.
